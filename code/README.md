# Project Name

Practice some parts of JavaScript by creating a chat bot, that will respond on three questions. The project is created with pair-programming

## The problem
We got 5 iteration that we needed to go through and we also got some code to begin with.

So with javaScript we changed the behaivour of the page. The work flow was to listen to an event, and then trigger some answer depending on answer fr√•n the user and then ask different questions.

 he hardest part was to create crete new buttons within the javaScript with innerHTML and not make the code to long.
 we used:
 - eventListener
 - if, if-else loop
 - innerHTML
 - global variable

If we had more time we would make the questions a bit more realistic and styled it.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
